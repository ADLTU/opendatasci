      "\n",
      "A histogram shows us the shape of the distribution of values for a **single** variable.\n",
      "On the x-axis we have the variable under question, divided into buckets or bins.  This is a key feature of a histogram.\n",
      "The bin size is adjustable and different bin sizes give different information.  A large bin size gives us an idea of the coarser grained structure of the distribution while a smaller bin size will shine light on the finer details of the distribution.  In either case we can compare distributions, or quickly identify some key hints that tell use how best to proceed.\n",

      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/histFicoScores.png\">\n",
      "  \n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we look at FICO score?  Because we know from domain knowledge that this is the primary determinant of interest rate.  \n",
      "The histogram shows us that the distribution is not a normal or gaussian distribution but that there are some other factors that might be affecting or distorting the shape of the distribution away from the bell curve.  We want to dig a little deeper.  \n",
      "\n",
      "###Box Plot\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we take a box plot which allows us to quickly look at the distribution of interest rates based on each FICO score range.   \n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/boxplot_fulldataset.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all this tells us that there is a general downward trend in interest rate for higher FICO scores.\n",
      "But, given the same range of FICO scores we see a range of interest rates not a single value - so it appears there are other factors determining interest rate, given the same FICO score range. We want to investigate the impact of these other drivers and quantify this impact.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What might these be?    \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's use domain knowledge again, a bit. We know interest rate is based on risk to the borrower, the greater the risk, the greater the interest rate charged to compensate for the risk.  Another factor that might affect risk is size of the loan - the larger the amount the greater the risk of non-payment and also the greater the negative impact of actual default.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to look at multiple factors and how they might affect the interest rate.  \n",
      "A great way to look at multiple factors simultaneously is the scatterplot matrix.  We are going to use this as the next step in visual exploration.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Scatterplot Matrix\n",
      "\n",
      "But first what is it?  \n",
      "\n",
      "The scatter plot matrix is a grid of plots of multiple variables against each other.  It shows the relationship of each variable to the others.  The ones on the diagonal are not meaningful. Why? What does it mean to find the relationship of something to itself, in this context.  Not much, since we are trying to determine the impact of some variables on **another** variable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "<img src=\"files/images/scatterplotmatrix5var.png\">\n",
      "\n",
      "In this diagram, traditionally, the boxes on the diagonal just contain the names of the variable, which tell us the row and columns dedicated to that variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "So if the 3rd variable is Loan Amount then the third row and third column are the Loan Amount column and row. To see how Loan Amount (3rd) affects Interest Rate (1st) then we look for the intersection of the third row and the 1st column.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Where there is some significant useful effect we will see a noticeable trend in the scatterplot at the intersection.  Where there is none we will see no noticeable trends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What do the last two sentences mean in practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compare two plots the first one at the intersection of 1st row and 2nd column, and the second at the intersection of 1st row 4th column.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first one FICO score shows an approximate but unmistakeable linear trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see that second one Monthly Income shows no impact as we move along the x-axis. All the dots are bunched up near one end but show no clear linear trend like the first one. \n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly there is no obvious variation in the plot for Loan Length while there is a distinct but increasing trend trend also in plot for Loan Amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this suggest?  It suggests that we should use FICO and Loan Amount in our model as independent variables, while Monthly Income and Loan Length don't seem to be too useful as independent variables."
