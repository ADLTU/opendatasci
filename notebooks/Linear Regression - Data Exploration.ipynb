      "### Data Cleanup \n",
      "\n",
      "We find the data is \"messy\" i.e isnt cleanly prepared for import - for instance numeric columns might have some strings in them.  \n",
      "This is very common in raw data especially that obtained from web sites.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see here that \n",
      "\n",
      "* the interest rate information has \"%\" symbols in it.\n",
      "* amount information has $ signs\n",

      "* there are a couple of values that are so large they must be typos\n",
      "* some values are missing \"NA\" values i.e. not available.\n",
      "\n",
      "After cleaning the data and converting categorical variables to character and then numeric, the lower limit of the range can be used as the FICO.Score variable.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "##Visual Exploration  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now we are going to follow a standard set of steps in exploring data.  We apply the following simple visualizations. This is something we will typically also do for other data sets we encounter in other explorations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "###Histogram\n",
      "\n",
      "A histogram shows us the shape of the distribution of values for a **single** variable.\n",
      "On the x-axis we have the variable under question, divided into buckets or bins.  This is a key feature of a histogram.\n",
      "The bin size is adjustable and different bin sizes give different information.  A large bin size gives us an idea of the coarser grained structure of the distribution while a smaller bin size will shine light on the finer details of the distribution.  In either case we can compare distributions, or quickly identify some key hints that tell use how best to proceed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the distribution of FICO scores we see...  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "[[ Figure. FICO score histogram ]]  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do we look at FICO score?  Because we know from domain knowledge that this is the primary determinant of interest rate.  \n",
      "The histogram shows us that the distribution is not a normal or gaussian distribution but that there are some other factors that might be affecting or distorting the shape of the distribution away from the bell curve.  We want to dig a little deeper.  \n",
      "\n",
      "###Box Plot\n",
      "\n",
      "Next we take a box plot which allows us to quickly look at the distribution of interest rates based on each FICO score range.   \n",
      "\n",
      "[[ Figure. Interest Rate vs FICO score box plot ]]  \n",
      "\n",
      "First of all this tells us that there is a general downward trend in interest rate for higher FICO scores.\n",
      "But, given the same range of FICO scores we see a range of interest rates not a single value - so it appears there are other factors determining interest rate, given the same FICO score range. We want to investigate the impact of these other drivers and quantify this impact.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What might these be?    \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's use domain knowledge again, a bit. We know interest rate is based on risk to the borrower, the greater the risk, the greater the interest rate charged to compensate for the risk.  Another factor that might affect risk is size of the loan - the larger the amount the greater the risk of non-payment and also the greater the negative impact of actual default.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to look at multiple factors and how they might affect the interest rate.  \n",
      "A great way to look at multiple factors simultaneously is the scatterplot matrix.  We are going to use this as the next step in visual exploration.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### Scatterplot Matrix\n",
      "\n",
      "But first what is it?  \n",
      "\n",
      "The scatter plot matrix is a grid of plots of multiple variables against each other.  It shows the relationship of each variable to the others.\n",
      "The ones on the diagonal are not meaningful. Why? What does it mean to find the relationship of something to itself, in this context.  Not much, since we are trying to determine the impact of some variables on **another** variable.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In this diagram, traditionally, the boxes on the diagonal just contain the names of the variable, which tell us the row and columns dedicated to that variable.\n",
      "So if the 3rd variable is ... then the third row and third column are the ... column and row. To see how ... (3rd) affects ... (4th) then we look for the intersection of the third row and the 4th column. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where there is some significant useful effect we will see a noticeable trend in the scatterplot at the intersection.\n",
      "What does that sentence mean in practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's compare two plots the one at the intersection of ... row and ... column\n",
      "We see that one of them [[ .. ]] shows no variation as we move along the x-axis. All the dots are spread out equally all along one value, more or less.\n",
      "The other one [[ FICO score ]] shows an approximate but unmistakeable linear trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly there is no obvious variation in plots ... and ... while there is a visible trend also in plot [[ loan length ]]\n",
      "\n",
      "So what does this suggest?  It suggests that we should use FICO and loan amount in our model as independent variables, while ... and ... dont seem to be useful\n",
      "as independent variables.\n",
      "\n",
      "So at the end of this data alchemy exercise we have distilled our variables into two beakers - one has what we believe is relevant - the data nuggets and the other with the data dross, the variables that have no visible impact on our dependent variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "We're going to refine our output even further into a model in the next step - the analysis.\n",
