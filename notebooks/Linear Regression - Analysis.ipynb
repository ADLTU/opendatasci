      "\n",
      "This report focuses on variables that affect interest rate for borrowers. The dataset uses historical data with a sample size of 2500 loans made at the Lending Club [1] a peer lending entity. Specifically this report focuses on what variables may be significant as predictors of interest rate when FICO scores are similar or identical.\n",
      "Expecting to use big data sets after this initial sample, the focus is on simple highly scalable techniques that could potentially be scaled to millions or even billions of rows. We specifically rule out a complete detailed analysis of all possible variables as we expect that the greatest leverage and insight per time spent could be gained by filtering out many variables based on domain knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "A much larger data set is available at Lending Club downloads, and the longer term goal is to be able to test these methods on the larger data set.\n",

      "\n",
      "We do some initial research about FICO [2], about loans, lenders, borrowers and risk and use knowledge gained to make some informal assessment about what might be useful investigation to follow. \n",
      "As a part of this we could look at the Lending Club web site to gain more detailed information about the Lending Club data set.\n",
      "\n",
      "A possible simple strategy is to use some exploratory analysis with visualization and summary statistics.\n",
      "On doing this we conclude that  multivariate linear regression is a good approach. Combining this with domain knowledge it becomes possible to focus on 2 or 3 most significant variables. \n",

      "We use domain knowledge to look at the underlying drivers of interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interest rate is proportional to risk so if we understand risk better we may understand useful predictors of interest rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see that risk consists of two components. One component is due to borrower credit history such as open credit lines etc. which is based on the past. The second is due to loan characteristics such as loan amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "To a first approximation we can say that FICO score is a good enough predictor of borrower risk and we want to understand loan based risk better as this is not represented in the FICO score which is about the borrower.\n",
      "We have three such variables loan purpose, loan amount and loan length.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also see from the Lending Club club data on Loan Purpose [3], see pie chart top right, that a high proportion of loans are for credit card consolidation so using loan purpose may not give useful discriminator power. Thus we focus on the variables \u201cLoan Amount\u201d and \u201cLoan Length\u201d\u201c and see how they affect interest rate if FICO Score is the same.\n",

      "GOAL: Investigate loan amount and loan length as predictors of interest rate when FICO score range is fixed, for the Lending Club sample of 2500 loans.\n",

      "From our exploratory analysis we saw three ranges of FICO score that appeared qualitatively different so we use the following model separately for each range.\n",

      "Combining domain knowledge to filter variables is a useful initial strategy for scalability.\n",
      "Given the same FICO range, loan amount is better predictor of interest rate than loan length.\n",
      "Linear Regression model for Mid FICO range is much better than for the other two which have large variance in interest rate. Better techniques than Linear Regression are needed for both outlier sets.\n",
      "The three-model approach allows us to separate borrower behavior into buckets that seem to track three different kinds of underlying patterns. However for the Low and High ranges our understanding is not great using Linear Regression\n",
