      "\n",
      "This function will need to have a value of 0 for the loss scores and 1 for the win scores.\n",
      "To make sense it will need to be 0 for some score and all scores below it and be 1 for some other score and all scores above it. And it will need to smoothly increase from 0 to 1 in the intermediate range.\n",

      "It will need to look something like this. [[ create custom plot with actual scores ]]\n",

      "$$P(x) = \\frac{1}{1 - e^{b_0 + b_1*x}}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "where P(x) is the probability of a score of x leading to a win.  \n",
      "$b_0, b_1$ are parameters that we will estimate, so the curve fits our data.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Notice that we have a familiar looking linear function but it's plugged into a formula that generates the shape we want.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So how does this formula predict Yes/No outcomes and why this function of all functions?  \n",
      "\n",
      "First the \"How\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "From the shape we can see that that if Score was less than 20 then P(x) would predict a loss, if Score was greater than 30, P(x) would predict a win. But in the middle things would be somewhat fuzzy - we would have even odds when the score was around 25.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this sort of function is what we use to model binary outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now about the \"Why\". So why this particular function and how did we derive it as a way to model binary outcomes?\n",

      "We need to take a real data set and do some exploration with it.  Then we'll do some analysis, as before.\n",
