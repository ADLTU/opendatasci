We're only going to look at one other column for now - the last one. The last column is a number we want to be close to zero and certainly $<=$ 0.05. For now suffice it to say that if we have this true for each of our coefficients then we have good confidence in the model.  \n",

      "Finally we look at the last two lines.  $R$-$squared$ or $R^2$  is a measure of how much of the variance in the data is captured by the model.  What does this mean? For now let's understand this as a measure of how well the model captures the spread of the observed values not just the average trend.  \n",

      "A high $R^2$ would be close to 1.0 a low one close to 0.  The value we have is 0.65 which is a reasonably good one.  The details of these error estimates deserve a separate discussion which we defer for another more detailed lesson.\n",
