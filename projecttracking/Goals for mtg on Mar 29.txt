Goals for mtg on Fri 29th
-------------------------

* Finish linear reg
status as of Thu 28th - 90% done - on track
* Finish logistic reg
status as of Thu 28th - 60% done - little behind
* Have a plan for next two weeks
** plan for k-means content
- use mobile data set and cluster around 6 cluster centroids - hoping to see correlations with human activity 
* use PCA to identify top 10-15 variables
* use SVD if necessary but this might be too involved mathematically
** plan for how to use Mobile dataset for k-means


** plan for how to use it for random forests 
TBD - that's the two weeks after
but for now Random Forests allow identifying which of the 500+ variables are really useful
