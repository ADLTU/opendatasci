Linear Regression Basics
A linear regression is a statistical model that attempts to show the relationship between two variables with a linear equation. A regression analysis involves graphing a line over a set of data points that most closely fits the overall shape of the data. A regression shows the extent to which changes in a "dependent variable," which is put on the y-axis, can be attributed to changes in an "explanatory variable," which is placed on the x-axis.
Evaluating Trends and Sales Estimates
Linear regressions can be used in business to evaluate trends and make estimates or forecasts. For example, if a company's sales have increased steadily every month for the past few years, conducting a linear analysis on the sales data with monthly sales on the y-axis and time on the x-axis would produce a line that that depicts the upward trend in sales. After creating the trend line, the company could use the slope of the line to forecast sales in future months.
Analyzing the Impact of Price Changes
Linear regression can also be used to analyze the effect of pricing on consumer behavior. For instance, if a company changes the price on a certain product several times, it can record the quantity it sells for each price level and then perform a linear regression with quantity sold as the dependent variable and price as the explanatory variable. The result would be a line that depicts the extent to which consumers reduce their consumption of the product as prices increase, which could help guide future pricing decisions.
Assessing Risk
Linear regression can be used to analyze risk. For example, a health insurance company might conduct a linear regression plotting number of claims per customer against age and discover that older customers tend to make more health insurance claims. The results of such an analysis might guide important business decisions made to account for risk.
