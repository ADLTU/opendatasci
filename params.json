{"name":"OpenDST","tagline":"The Open Data Science Training Project","body":"### Welcome to OpenDST.\r\n\r\n#### Mission\r\n\r\nOpen Data Science Training is a repository of freely available resources for self-directed learning in Data Science.  The resources include lessons, curated datasets and exercises with a focus on practical and immediate applicability.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to enable sufficiently motivated and technically capable learners to use data science techniques in their applications without having to go get a degree in data science.\r\n\r\nThe target audience is anyone who is motivated to learn data science and is not afraid of a small amount of math, which is introduced gently.\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that the user is open to expanding and enhancing their math skills as a result of using these materials. Supplementary math learning resources are either provided or pointed too.\r\n\r\nThe approach is breadth first, so that a user may learn at a level comfortable to them or can dig deeper, but useful results and techniques are available with a small amount of learning, and not postponed for a semester or after a degree program.\r\n\r\nThe long term goal is to evolve towards a self-sustaining self-organizing community around Data Science learning, with ongoing knowledge creation via forums and community driven curation.\r\n\r\n#### The Content\r\n\r\nThe current state of the content is beta.  It is based on IPython Notebook and Python based Data Science libraries.\r\n\r\n#### Background\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with IPython Notebook you can start with http://ipython.org/notebook\r\n\r\n#### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nOne of the following distributions is needed.\r\n\r\n* EPD Free Enthought Python Distribution from http://enthought.com\r\n* Anaconda Python from http://continuum.io \r\n\r\nDevelopment has been done on v 1.5 of Anaconda distribution but EPD Free should work just as well.\r\n\r\nPlease note that even if you have Python installed it is important to have one of these distributions installed and the binary for this installation in your path.  This is because these distributions come packaged with all the supplementary libraries needed and these have been historically difficult to install separately.\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nThese steps assume you have installed one of the distributions mentioned in prerequisites.\r\n\r\n##### From the zip for tar file\r\n\r\n* download and unpack the file to a directory called opendst\r\n* cd to the 'notebooks' subdirectory\r\n* start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'\r\n\r\n##### From the git repo\r\n\r\n* clone the repo\r\n* cd to 'notebooks'\r\n* start IPython Notebook 'ipython notebook --pylab=inline'\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
